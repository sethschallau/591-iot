Course Project for CSC 591 

Team 5

Project: We propose a smart home device that tracks automatically rotates paper towels so the user doesn't have to touch the roll when cooking and then provides analytics on a homes paper towel usage and provides feedback on their fiscal and environmental impact due to their paper towel consumption. The project will consist of a stepper motor and a custom paper towel enclosure that rotates when an ultrasonic sensor  detects a user waving for a paper towel. We will also publish to a broker and subscribe with a web service that will display the usage patterns and analyze how many rolls have been used.
